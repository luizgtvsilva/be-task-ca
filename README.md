# Simple Shop Monolith to Microservice - Clean Architecture

This project is a very naive implementation of a simple shop system. It mimics in its structure a real-world example of a service that was prepared for being split into microservices.

## How to use this project

If you have not installed poetry you find instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/).

1. `docker-compose up` - runs a postgres instance for development
2. `poetry install` - install all dependency for the project
3. `poetry run schema` - creates the database schema in the postgres instance
4. `poetry run start` - runs the development server at port 8000
5. `/postman` - contains an postman environment and collections to test the project

## Other commands

* `poetry run graph` - draws a dependency graph for the project
* `poetry run tests` - runs the test suite
* `poetry run lint` - runs flake8 with a few plugins
* `poetry run format` - uses isort and black for autoformating
* `poetry run typing` - uses mypy to typecheck the project

## Specification - A simple shop

* As a customer, I want to be able to create an account so that I can save my personal information.
* As a customer, I want to be able to view detailed product information, such as price, quantity available, and product description, so that I can make an informed purchase decision.
* As a customer, I want to be able to add products to my cart so that I can easily keep track of my intended purchases.
* As an inventory manager, I want to be able to add new products to the system so that they are available for customers to purchase.
